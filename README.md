# RealEstateApp

This is a listings app with basic CRUD functionality to play with .NET core and the Microsoft Entity Framework. To run - install .NET core onto your machine https://www.microsoft.com/net/core 

Inside of the repository, run `dotnet run` and you should see the app start to build/run.

Navigate to `locahost:5000/listings` to see the initial page.

Built the whole thing in .NET MVC to keep the dependency tree down. Would like to use React to replace the views and handle states. 

Still need to implement a basic search functionality on the listings page as well.

No styling was made to the page besides a bootstrap header from yo generation :-), TODO.
